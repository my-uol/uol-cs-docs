# Physical Computing and the Internet of Things
  
Physical computing involves the creation of hardware devices that can sense and act in the real world. Physical computing techniques underpin a wide range of contemporary technology trends such as the Internet of Things, the quantified self and smart homes. There are many applications of physical computing, for example in creative arts, museums, ubiquitous and embedded computing, scientific sensing, robotics, engineering control systems and robotics.

**By studying this degree you will:**

- design devices that compute in real life settings
- learn how to connect these virtually to each other and globally via the internet.
- apply your learned skills in the creative arts, smart homes, robotics, engineering control systems and many more computer related areas.
