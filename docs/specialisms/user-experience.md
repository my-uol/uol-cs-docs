# User Experience

Our daily lives involve complex tasks, requiring interaction with a plethora of computer systems. User experience design is a critical part of the development of these systems. These advancements ensure the interaction between the individual, computer system and the workflow it enables are all fit for purpose.

User experience design or UX has grown out of the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), which is about how to design computer systems for use by people. HCI is a major subfield of computer science, and it has informed the visual design and workflow of computer systems we use every day. HCI draws on a range of hard and soft skills and is a naturally cross-disciplinary subject.

**By studying this degree you will:**

- understand HCI and how to apply its principles across multiple development environments
- carry out a substantial project where you have implemented and evaluated a user experience
- gain the technical and theoretical know-how you will need to implement effective user experiences in software.
