# Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Machine learning and artificial intelligence are starting to play far bigger roles in our daily lives. They are used in digital assistants that respond to our voices, self-driving cars and adaptive education systems.

Machine learning provides a means for computer systems to extract useful information out of data. These techniques are widely used in the technology industry for a variety of applications, for example, recommending music and other products to people, identifying faces in photos and predicting trends in financial markets.

**By studying this degree you will:**

- gain the mathematical and engineering knowledge to construct working machine learning and AI systems.
- learn how machines make sense of the world through intelligent signal processing.
- carry out a substantial practical project where you’ll construct an AI system and apply it to a problem.
