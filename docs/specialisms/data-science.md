# Data Science
  
You can either apply via [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london) or [University Of London](https://www.london.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/bsc-computer-science#apply) site, don't forget that the applications are usually open at these months:

- April Cohort: **December to March**
- October Cohort:  **June to September**

(*Usually the application deadline is extended, but it's better to apply as soon as you can*).

## Process and fees

 To apply for this programme you will be required to pay a **£107 non-refundable** application fee.

The application process it's easy to follow and it's nothing more than a form with multiple pages, just make sure that you will:

- Have the rights documents (Birth certificate, passport or national identification card)
- Have the english certification/proficiency test (APTIS, Duolingo, IELTS, TOEFL & others)
- Have transcripts for direct acces or **Recognition of Prior Learning**
- Give your real information (Address, full name, birth date & etc.)

After completing and have your payment confirmed by *UoL*, you just need to wait (days or weeks) for a response via e-mail.

## Post application

After you receive your response you will know which pathway you will need to go through:

- **Direct/General Admission** or **PBA (Performance-Based Admission)**
  
This will differ how you will start the programme, the only difference is that on the first term/semester, you can only register to 2 (two) modules and you’ll also need to achieve a pass (40% weighted average or higher) in *Introduction to Programming I* and either *Computational* or *Discrete Mathematics* to remain on the course.
