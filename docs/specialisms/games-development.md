You need to demonstrate a good level of English to be admitted to our programmes. We accept a range of evidence, including proficiency test scores. If you don’t have evidence but believe you can meet the standard, we may consider your case.

For direct access to the BSc Computer Science degrees, you will usually meet the following criteria:

- Age 17+ by the registration deadline of your enrolment session.
- GCSE Mathematics (Grade A*-B / 9-5) or AS Level Mathematics (A-E), or equivalent.
- Satisfy our General Entrance Requirements.

For access by  **Performance-Based Admission:**

If you do not meet the academic requirements for direct entry, you can apply for the programme via the performance based admission route.

To be eligible to register, you must normally:

- Age 17+ by the registration deadline of your enrolment session.
- Have passed at least four separate subjects at GCSE level, with grades A* - C / 9 - 4, or the equivalent. Equivalents include successful completion of the US High School Diploma.
- If you do not satisfy the above GCSE requirement then Work experience will be considered on an individual basis.

If registering through the performance based route you must satisfy the following before progressing onto the direct entry:

- Pass both Introduction to Programming I and either Computational or Discrete Mathematics with a weighted average of 40% or above.

If you are unsure as to which entry route you are eligible for, please apply via the standard entry route only. If you do not meet all of the entrance criteria for this route your application will automatically be considered for Performance-Based Admission.

Even if you do not meet the standard requirements, we will consider each application on its own merits. Our Admissions Panel will consider whether any alternative/incomplete qualifications or work experience you have are suitable for entry to the programme.

## Other requirements
