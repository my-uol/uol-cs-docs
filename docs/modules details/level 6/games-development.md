# Games Development
  
This module builds on other modules in the programme, and through it, you will gain experience in the video game development toolkit and process. Video games are a critical application area for computer science, and the games industry forms a significant part of the creative economy. It is a complicated subject, drawing on other areas such as computer graphics, interaction design and artificial intelligence. 

Develop simple computer games to comply with industry practice, using specialist technical skills acquired in other modules. You will be introduced to tools such as game engines and the processes of game development, including prototyping and play-testing. Your projects involve proposing a game to fit a specific brief and then delivering it with documentation. This module will also introduce key game AI concepts, which is pivotal for contemporary video game production.
