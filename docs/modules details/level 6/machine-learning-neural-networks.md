# Machine Learning and Neural Networks
  
Machine learning and neural networks provide means for computer systems to extract useful information out of data. These techniques are widely used in the technology industry for a variety of applications, for example, recommending music and other products to people, identifying faces in photos and predicting trends in financial markets.

You will learn how to solve common machine learning problems such as regression, classification, clustering, matrix completion and pattern recognition. You will learn about neural networks and how they can be trained and optimised, including an exploration of deep neural networks.

You will learn about machine learning and neural network software libraries that allow you to develop machine learning systems rapidly, and you will learn how to verify and evaluate the results.
