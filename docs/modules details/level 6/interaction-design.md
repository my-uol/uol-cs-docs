# Interaction Design
  
This module provides you with knowledge and methods from the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) about how to better design computer systems for use by humans. This module complements other, more programming intensive modules by providing theory and techniques which will help you to design more usable computer systems.

When taking this module, you will examine the notion of 'interaction with technology'. You will focus on the concepts behind modern user experience design and production. You will gain a solid grasp and practical experience of the process which allows the creation of interactive systems.
