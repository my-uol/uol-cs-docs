# Programming with Data
  
Increasingly, computer systems in research and industry are designed to leverage large amounts of data. The data explored by such systems are rich and various: they could include anything from the results of clinical trials to information gleaned from analysing millions of tweets to understanding how people talk positively and negatively about politics.This module will show you how to work with data: getting data from a variety of sources and visualising data in compelling, informative ways.

You will also be shown how to process data to make it useful and shareable, and reasoning with data to test hypotheses and make parameterised predictions. The module will also introduce you to a new language and programming environment that is well-adapted to languages for these applications.
