This module aims to provide insights and practice in software development using contemporary methods to produce software that meets the needs of users and supports an organisation’s business function. The module will enable you to gain competence in the conceptualisation of a technology-based solution to a real-world problem, fulfilling the requirements of users and taking constraints imposed by the prevailing and foreseen market conditions and lessons learned from prototypes into account. 

You will be given the opportunity to present a proposal for a technical project including a structured plan for implementing the solution using the agile development methodology and test driven development practices. During the whole process from concept to solution presentation, you will be required to work in a distributed team using online collaboration, project tracking and version control tools.
