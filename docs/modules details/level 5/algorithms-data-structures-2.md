# Algorithms and Data Structures II
  
Algorithms and data structures are critical elements of the body of knowledge of computer science. Knowledge of a range of algorithms and data structures will allow you to solve common programming problems more rapidly. Within the programme, this module builds on the knowledge and skills gained in Algorithms and Data Structures 1.

This module aims to provide you with detailed knowledge of several common algorithms and data structures. You will improve your understanding of searching and sorting and learn new algorithms to solve new problems. and learn about a range of data structures.

You will learn how to evaluate and describe the performance of algorithms using big-O notation and how to choose appropriate data structures for representing problems,

You will be expected to have mastered the material in Algorithms and Data Structures I before attempting this module.
