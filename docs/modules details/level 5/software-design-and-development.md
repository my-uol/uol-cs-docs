# Software Design and Development
  
This module aims to advance your software development skills so that you can write more robust and complicated programs. You will learn how to use a range of programming techniques that will allow you to deal with unwanted or unexpected events that might happen when your application is running. 

You will use defensive coding to check data before processing it, and exception handling to gracefully manage unforeseen or unwanted occurrences. You will learn how to discuss program structure concerning cohesion (how to meaningfully organise code into modules) and coupling (how to define the interactions between different parts of the program). You will learn about test-driven development, where you write tests for your code, and write the code itself, in parallel. You will also learn how to use software versioning tools to manage a software project as it develops.
