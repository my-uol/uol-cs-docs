# Computational Mathematics
  
This module helps you hone your skills in thinking abstractly. It also introduces you to many of the standard continuous models used to help understand and design computational systems. Through this module, you will develop the fundamental computational mathematical tools that will support you throughout the BSc programme. Particular attention is paid to notions of experimentation, reasoning, and generalisation.

By taking this module, you will learn a wide range of the computational mathematical concepts and techniques that underpin Computer Science. In particular, you will study number systems, special functions, graphing and linear algebra.
