# Discrete Mathematics
  
This module helps you to hone your skills in thinking abstractly. It also introduces you to many of the standard discrete models used to help understand and design computational systems.

Through this module, you will develop the fundamental discrete mathematical tools that will support you throughout the BSc programme. Particular attention is paid to notions of experimentation, reasoning, and generalisation.
