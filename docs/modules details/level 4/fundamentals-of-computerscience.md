# Fundamentals of Computer Science
  
By taking this module, you will gain a broad understanding of many of the key topic areas in computer science and the fundamental concepts that underpin them.

In the area of fundamental concepts, you will study binary representations and logic, complexity theory and theories of computation, finite state machines and Turing machines. Building on this, you will then study key areas of interest in computer science including databases, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. These will be presented in the light of practical examples to illustrate how they are implemented in modern computer systems.
