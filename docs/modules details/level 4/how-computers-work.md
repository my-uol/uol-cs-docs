# How Computers Work
  
This module aims to help you understand, and to interact with, computer systems. You will learn how to use knowledge about computational processes to analyse and explain the behaviour of computer systems. 

The module will use the concept of a Notional Machine, an abstract representation of the functioning of a computer system, to help you to reason about computer systems and to predict their behaviour. You will also learn about typical computer system architectures, basic networking and network services such as databases.
