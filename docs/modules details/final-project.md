# Final Project
  
This module provides an opportunity to work individually on an extended project. You will be expected to develop an idea for software development or research project and then carry it out. It pulls together the streams of study, knowledge and practical skills gained in other modules into a single, long-form project.

In this module, you will undertake a substantial independent project that will allow you to demonstrate a wide range of skills such as project planning, management, research, software implementation, and written presentation.
